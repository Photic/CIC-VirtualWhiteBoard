## Completed Backend
    - Sam and Bertha wants to use the virtual whiteboard, to do this they must first login with the team given login
    - Sam wants to create a new piece of text to put onto the virtual board so that he can write a motivational text, he wants it to be as long as a tweet 
    - Sam wants to delete a post he's created, the youtube video was not as fun as he remembered it
    - Bertha's lunch has been stolen from the fridge and would like to put an anonymous post up that tells the thief off

## Completed Frontend
    - Sam and Bertha wants to use the virtual whiteboard, to do this they must first login with the team given login
    - Sam and Bertha are sick and tired of random people deleting their posts, they want their own logins and to only be able to delete their own posts
    - Sam wants to create a new piece of text to put onto the virtual board so that he can write a motivational text, he wants it to be as long as a tweet 

# Init node_modules
This is a project created with Angular / Angular Materials, nodejs / Express. So the project requires the latest version of nodejs install on the local machine or docker. 

If only using Docker, skip to [Building to Docker](#building-to-docker).

To initiate the project, run following:
```
npm run init
``` 

In the default directory "./" where AngularÂ´s package.json resides.

# Running
Skip if not running nodejs.

Opening 2 terminal, and typing in:
```
npm run dev
```
In:
```
./
and
./server
```

Will run the "ng-serve" with an attached proxy connection and "nodemon ." which restarts the server with every code change made.

# Building to Docker
In the default directory, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will not only build the angular project, but it will also begin the build process of the Dockerfile within the ./server folder. It goes without saying that this step required Docker to be installed on the local machine. 

After the script has run, you should be able to see the docker image with:
```
docker images
```

To run the image enter:
```
docker run --restart=always --hostname whiteboard-app --name=whiteboard-app --publish=:8080:8080 --detach nullergrisen/whiteboard-app
```

The server will be running at http://0.0.0.0:8080
